## Usage

The behaviour of the code can be changed trought the config file. If have_csv is set to False in USER config the script will scrape Steam Marketplace and Fandom for skin prices and generate a CSV file with all the data. This process takes around 3 hours so one CSV file is already provided in the utilities directory. 
Second mode gets selected by setting have_csv to True in USER config. Then the code predicts price for all 5 different coditions of a weapon according to these following atributes: Weapon type, Year of release and Quality which can all be chosen in the configuration file in the USER config.
